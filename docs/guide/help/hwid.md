# HWID

This page will explain what HWID is, why, and how it is used within RusherHack.

## **What is HWID (Hardware ID)?**

HWID stands for Hardware ID, which is a unique identifier tied to your computer. 
It is used by us, to uniquely identify and verify that your account isn't being used on
someone else's computer. The HWID is generated based on over several 
hardware components to create a unique identifier for your system.
Since each computer's hardware setup is different, the resulting HWID is 
unique to that specific machine.

We employ a HWID-based licensing or security model that can tie an account or license to a 
particular computer, making it more difficult to share or transfer accounts between people (Known as account sharing which
is against the ToS). 

HWIDs are primarily used for:

- Preventing unauthorized access (e.g., stopping RusherHack from being reused on multiple computers)
- Enforcing single-user licenses to prevent account sharing

## **A second HWID**

RusherHack does allow multiple (max of 2) computers to be used under the same license 
if certain conditions are met, if you need to use more than 2 computers, 
you will need to purchase an additional license.
